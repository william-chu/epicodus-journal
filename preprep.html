          <h2>CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
          <p>Participating in a coding bootcamp wasn't a decision that I made lightly. I began my previous career in IT as a work-study at my university's residential computing department. Upon graduation, I spent 7 more years learning and growing as an IT professional. However, after observing the traditional advancement paths available to someone in my position, I decided to enroll at Epicodus in hopes of transitioning into front-end web development.</p>
          <p>Although coding bootcamps aren't as expensive as a traditional 4 year degree, they aren't exactly cheap. Add on the fact that many programs require your full-time commitment. You will need to pay tuition and, at minimum, living expenses for the duration of the program. Students that are leaving a previous profession have to consider the opportunity cost of the wages they would have earned.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, coding bootcamps do not guarantee outcomes. Many of them advertise job placement metrics, however, completing a coding bootcamp does not mean that you will have a job waiting for you upon graduation. To my knowledge, no coding bootcamps are not accredited institutions. That means that fancy certificate of completion doesn't carry any official weight or significance like a standard degree.</p>
          <p>This isn't to say that coding bootcamps are a sham, but you should do your research. Some of the existing programs appear to be operating in a way that is reminiscent of now defunct for-profit, educational institutions like ITT Tech. If you aren't sure about which programs are legitimate, search the web for student reviews or use the <a href="https://cirr.org/">CIRR report</a> to get standardized reports participating schools.</p>

          <h2>I'M STILL HERE...</h2>
          <p>Congratulations! You've gotten yourself to a place where you are ready to commit yourself to learning how to code. Aside from following through on the instructions outlined by your school for enrollment, here are a few things that I did during the months leading up that have served me well. If you've already begun your program, no need to worry. You can always set aside time to do a mental check-in and self-directed learning outside of class.</p>

              <h5>SET PROPER EXPECTATIONS</h5>
              <p>Your goal is to get a job at the end of the program, not a certificate. Doing the bare minimum or just what you are asked is not going to build your knowledge or impress your future employer.</p>
              <h5>BE ACCOUNTABLE</h5>
              <p>If you don't understand, look it up. If you still don't understand, ask someone else. Still doesn't make sense? Don't give up, you learn the most when you struggle.</p>
              <h5>FOCUS ON YOU</h5>
              <p>Some people are naturally gifted with technical aptitude. However, everyone is in control of being proactive and setting aside time to prepare. This can level the playing field. Focus on what you can control.</p>
              <h5>STAY HEALTHY</h5>
              <p>Remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Set behaviors and actions that are sustainable so you don't burn yourself out.</p>
