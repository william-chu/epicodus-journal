          <h2>WHY PREPARE?</h2>
          <p>Participating in a coding bootcamp wasn't a decision that I made lightly. I began my previous career in IT as a work-study at my university's residential computing department. Upon graduation, I spent 7 more years learning and growing as an IT professional. However, after observing the traditional advancement paths available to someone in my position, I decided to enroll at Epicodus in hopes of transitioning into front-end web development.</p>
          <p>Although coding bootcamps aren't as expensive as a traditional 4 year degree, they aren't exactly cheap. Add on the fact that many programs require your full-time commitment. You will need to pay tuition and, at a minimum, the living expenses for the duration of the program. Students that are leaving a previous profession have to consider the opportunity cost of the wages they would have earned.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, coding bootcamps do not guarantee outcomes. Many of them advertise job placement metrics, however, completing a coding bootcamp does not mean that you will have a job waiting for you upon graduation. To my knowledge, no coding bootcamps are not accredited institutions. That means that fancy certificate of completion doesn't carry any official weight or significance like a standard degree.</p>
          <p>This isn't to say that coding bootcamps are a sham, but you should do your research. Some of the existing programs appear to be operating in a way that is reminiscent to now defunct for-profit, educational institutions like ITT Tech. If you aren't sure about which programs are legitimate, search the web for reviews or use the <a href="https://cirr.org/">CIRR report</a> to get standardized reports participating schools.
