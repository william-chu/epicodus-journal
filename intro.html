          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Introduction to Programming begins by teaching students about HTML and CSS. Students are introduced to Bootstrap, a free and open-source front-end library. Weeks 2 - 4 focus on basic use of jQuery and JavaScript. The 5th week is spent building and presenting a team project. Students learn to work with Git branching and merging code conflicts.</p>

          <h4>Week 1: Git, HTML and CSS</h4>
          <p>This week we learned about the building blocks of making basic web pages: HTML and CSS. We also focused on using the command line and Git to create a daily workflow for our coding projects.</p>

            <div class="panel-body compressed-section">
              <h4>Basic Terminal Commands</h4>
              <h5>$ cd [folder name]</h5>
              <p>Enter cd to change the directory, cd .. will take you to the parent directory, cd ~ will take you to the home directory</p>
              <h5>$ pwd</h5>
              <p>Enter pwd to print the working directory, the working directory is the folder you are currently navigating</p>
              <h5>$ ls</h5>
              <p>Enter ls to view the files and folders of your current location. If you enter ls -a this will show you hidden files and folders.</p>
              <h5>$ touch [file name]</h5>
              <p>Enter touch to create a file, if you want to create a file inside of an existing folder, enter touch folder/file name</p>
              <h5>$ mkdir [folder name]</h5>
              <p>Enter mkdir to make a directory</p>
              <h5>$ rm [file or folder name]</h5>
              <p>Enter rm to remove a file or folder, if you are removing a directory, you will need to enter rm -r [folder name], the "r" stands for recursive, which tells the terminal to delete the folder and any files or subfolders that it contains</p>
              <h5>$ mv [current file or folder name] [new file or folder name]</h5>
              <p>Enter mv and specify the current and desired name to move and/or rename a file or folder</p>
              <h4>Git Commands</h4>
              <h5>$ touch .pairs</h5>
              <p>For pair programming, you will need to create the .pairs file in the home directory, enter cd ~ to navigate to the home directory before creating the .pairs file. Open the file in Atom by entering atom .pairs after creating the file. In the .pairs file, follow this format:<br><br>pairs:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;user 1's initials: user 1's full name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;user 2's initials: user 2's full name<br>email:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;user 1's initials: user 1's email address<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;user 2's initials: user 2's email address</p>
              <h5>$ git config --global user.name "user's full name"</h5>
              <h5>$ git config --global user.email "user's email address"</h5>
              <p>Enter these commands on Fridays if you use the computers in the classroom for your solo projects, this information is used when you make commits</p>
              <h5>$ git init</h5>
              <p>Enter git init to a new Git repository, this command should be run inside of the folder that you create for your project</p>
              <h5>$ remote add [remote name] [url for online Git repo]</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to designate a name and remote repository, you will use this for pushing your changes to the reposity on the GitHub website, if you need to see a list of the remotes currently set up in the folder, enter git remote -v</p>
              <h5>$ git add .</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to add all changes in the working directory to the staging area. This needs to be done before making a commit</p>
              <h5>$ git status</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to see the state of the working directory and staging area</p>
              <h5>$ git-pair-commit -m "commit message"</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to commit the changes that were added to the staging area, using git-pair-commit will use the information from the .pairs file and alternate credit for a commit between the two users. Commit messages should be written in present tense and logically flow after the statement "This will..." When working solo just enter git commit -m "commit message"</p>
              <h5>$ git log</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to see a list of the past commits and their messages</p>
              <h5>$ git push [remote name] [branch name]</h5>
              <p>Enter this command to push committed changes from your local repository stored on the computer to a remote repository on the GitHub website</p>

            <div class="panel-heading bg-atom">Atom<img src="img/atom.svg" alt="atom graphic"></div>
            <div class="panel-body compressed-section">
              <h4>Application View</h4>
              <h5>Soft Wrap</h5>
              <p>You can find this under Settings for &lt;&gt;Editor, enabling soft wrap makes text display on the next line based on the width of the application window rather than running off the page</p>
              <h5>Split Right, Left, Up or Down</h5>
              <p>If you right click an open tab in Atom, you can split the page allowing you to view two or more tabs at the same time. This is helpful when you are working on multiple files simultaneously or you need to reference something from another page</p>
              <h5>Collapsing Code</h5>
              <p>Each line of code has a number to the left of it to help you navigate. If you hover over the number you can collapse or expand nested HTML tags, this is extremely helpful when navigating a file with lots of content</p>
              <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
              <p>For a more extensive shortcut list, check out this <a href="files/atom-editor-cheat-sheet.pdf" target="-_blank">cheatsheet</a>. Here is a list of shortcuts that I discovered and used the most during my first few weeks:</p>
              <h5>Auto-Fill</h5>
              <p>Begin typing an element in HTML without the opening < bracket and then press tab to have it auto-complete. This is helpful when you can't remember the exact syntax for an HTML element and it's common attributes. If you type HTML and have it auto-fill, it will create the header and body tags for your empty .html document.</p>
              <h5>Move Line Up or Down</h5>
              <p>Ctrl+Cmd+Up/Down will move the active line or lines of text up and down in the editor. It also maintains indentation, the shortcut is Ctrl+Up/Down on Windows</p>
              <h5>Convert Line to Comment</h5>
              <p>Ctrl+Cmd+/ will convert the active line or lines of text into a comment. Comments are a great way to clarify the structure of your code or to disable lines of code for testing purposes, the shortcut is Ctrl+/ on Windows</p>
              <h5>Multiple Cursors</h5>
              <p>Ctrl+Cmd+Left Click will create multiple cursors on the screen. This is helpful if you want to make changes in multiple places like creating multiple &lt;li&gt; tags, the shortcut is Ctrl+Left Click on Windows</p>
              <h5>Markdown Preview</h5>
              <p>Ctrl+Shift+M will allow you to preview markdown in the Atom editor. This is helpful when writing README.md files for your projects</p>

            <div class="panel-body compressed-section">
              <h5>STAY FOCUSED</h5>
              <p>You are attending a bootcamp so that you have dedicated time to learn. Remember that the duration of the program is limited. Avoid distractions like checking your phone.</p>
              <h5>ORGANIZE YOUR CODE</h5>
              <p>When classroom exercises detail best practices, try to establish these principles in your coding habits immediately. It takes much more effort to unlearn bad behaviors than establishing good ones.</p>
              <h5>INDEX.HTML</h5>
              <p>Start naming your project .html files index.html so they can be published to gh-pages for live demonstrations.</p>
              <h5>CREATE PROJECT TEMPLATE</h5>
              <p>After you have learned how to create folders for your local Git repos, set up a project template and push it to your GitHub account. Add and link Bootstrap.css, jQuery.js, styles.css and scripts.js files to a blank index.html file. Create a README.md prefilled with your name and areas where you can write the project name, description, specifications, setup/install requirements, known bugs, technologies used and licensing information. Update this template as you progress through the program. This will save you time and standardize the organization of your repos.</p>
