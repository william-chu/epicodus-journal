# **Epicodus Journal**

#### By William Chu

## Description

Digital journal of my Epicodus experience along with interview prep and transitioning back into the workplace.

## Self-Assessment

Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

* I am most concerned about technical interviews because I generally don't feel confident expressing understanding of technical terminology through conversation. This was a problem even when I was interviewing for positions in IT with multiple years of experience.

* Whiteboarding feels very unnatural and I want to spend additional time outside of class studying algorithms and other traditional CS concepts that I lack due to my educational background in business.

Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

* From what I understand, getting your first job in development is made much simpler if you have a personal connection in the industry. Trying to juggle this aspect of the job hunt along with devoting time to becoming more skilled as a developer is a tricky balance. Once I do get a job, I have the expectation that things will get more difficult since we will be faced with learning on the job and our mistakes will have real implications for clients.

* Knowing more about what it is like working in development through my internship and finding my first full-time opportunity to prove myself. I am confident in my ability to learn because I am dedicated and have a strong work ethic, I just need someone to give me a chance.
