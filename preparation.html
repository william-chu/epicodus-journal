          <h2>CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
          <p>Participating in a coding bootcamp wasn't a decision that I made lightly. I began my previous career in IT as a work-study at my university's residential computing department. Upon graduation, I spent 7 more years learning and growing as an IT professional. However, after observing the traditional advancement paths available to someone in my position, I decided to enroll at Epicodus in hopes of transitioning into front-end web development.</p>
          <p>Although coding bootcamps aren't as expensive as a traditional 4 year degree, they aren't cheap. Add on the fact that many programs require your full-time commitment. You will need to pay tuition and, at minimum, living expenses for the duration of the program with little to no income. Students that are leaving a previous profession should consider the opportunity cost of lost wages.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, coding bootcamps do not guarantee outcomes. Many of them advertise job placement metrics, however, completing a coding bootcamp does not mean that you will have a job waiting for you upon graduation. To my knowledge, no coding bootcamp is credentialed as an accredited institution. That means the fancy certificate of completion doesn't carry any official weight or significance like a traditional educational degree.</p>
          <p>This isn't to say that coding bootcamps are a sham, but you should do your research. As they have grown in popularity, some programs appear to be operating in a way that is reminiscent of now defunct for-profit, educational institutions like ITT Tech. If you aren't sure which programs are legitimate, search the web for student reviews at <a href="https://www.switchup.org/" target="_blank">SwitchUp</a>, <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/" target="_blank">Course Report</a> or use the <a href="https://cirr.org/" target="_blank">CIRR report</a> to view standardized outcomes reports of participating schools.</p>

          <h2>TRY BEFORE YOU BUY</h2>
          <p>You should definitely try some free programming tutorials before enrolling in a coding bootcamp. The first reason is to gauge your interest. If you don't have enough focus to complete modules online in your free time or you find the material extremely uninteresting, you should take that as an immediate red flag for your career aspirations in development.</p>
          <p>It's also a good idea to expose yourself to the syntax of the material you'll be learning to avoid going in blind. Trying to decipher code for the first time in the classroom is a recipe for feeling overwhelmed. Don't worry about starting your program over-prepared. Any time you invest learning upfront will be greatly appreciated by your future self. Similar to watching a film for the second or third time, you'll catch a lot of details you missed during your first viewing.</p>
          <p>Here are some materials that I used which were helpful in preparing for bootcamp:</p>

          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading bg-htmlcss">HTML/CSS<img src="img/art.svg" alt="art graphic"></div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <h5>FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF</h5>
              <p>Complete the HTML and CSS modules at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> to understand the syntax. You will be moving through this material quickly in the first week so it's best to get accustomed to it before you start.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <h5>GET ACQUAINTED</h5>
              <p>Try the JavaScript and jQuery modules at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> to get your feet wet. It's very different than HTML and CSS so if you prefer extra time to learn technical material you're better off starting early.</p>

          <h2>I'M STILL HERE...</h2>
          <p>Congratulations! You've gotten yourself to a place where you are ready to commit yourself to learning how to code. Aside from following through on the instructions outlined by your school for enrollment, here are a few things that I did (or wish I had done) during the months leading up to the program. If you've already started, no need to worry. You can always set aside time to go through these mental check-ins and self-directed learning outside of class.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <h5>SET PROPER EXPECTATIONS</h5>
              <p>Your goal is to get a job at the end of the program, not a certificate. Doing the bare minimum or just what you are asked is not going to build your knowledge or impress your future employer.</p>
              <h5>BE ACCOUNTABLE</h5>
              <p>If you don't understand, look it up. If you still don't understand, ask someone else. Still doesn't make sense? Don't give up, you learn the most when you struggle.</p>
              <h5>FOCUS ON YOU</h5>
              <p>Some people are naturally gifted with technical aptitude. However, everyone is in control of being proactive and setting aside time to prepare. Focus on what you can control to help level the playing field.</p>
              <h5>STAY HEALTHY</h5>
              <p>Remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Set behaviors and actions that are sustainable so you don't burn yourself out.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <h5>TRY COMMAND LINE</h5>
              <p>If you aren't familiar with basic file structures or terminal commands, you can try the command line and Git modules at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.</p>
              <h5>CREATE YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT</h5>
              <p>You will need this for class to store your homework and projects. Pick something professional for your username and a password that can be typed from memory. You will need to authenticate regularly when pushing your changes to GitHub during class. Do the same for your Epicenter password.</p>

              <h5>INSTALL ATOM</h5>
              <p><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> is a free, open-source text and source code editor. You will receive instructions on how to configure this on your personal computer at the start of the program.</p>
              <h5>PRACTICE YOUR TYPING</h5>
              <p>If you become a developer you are going to be spending most of your day on a keyboard. Accuracy is more important than speed. Sloppy typing will lead you to spending a lot more time figuring out why your code doesn't work.</p>
